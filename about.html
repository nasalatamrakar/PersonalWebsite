    <h2>When I am outside class...</h2>
    <p1>I enjoy spending time with my kitten, Percy. I recently got him at the end of Decemember and have to make sure he is getting enough food and attention.
        <br>I spend a lot of time on my laptop, whether it is searching up new jobs or just streaming Grey's Anatomy. I also have the unfortunate habit of online shopping and spending a lot of money on unnecessary things<br>
        I also enjoy spending time in the kitchen, although I am more of a baker than a cook. I have a killer chocolate chip walnut cookie recipe and I have had many requests to make some chai sugar cookies.
        <br>I have also dabbled into cake making on request. So far I have only attempted to make cheesecakes and tiramisu from scratch.<br>
        Another interest of mine is music. I love listening to all sorts of music and even playing music. I will dabble into any genre, expect country so sorry to any country music lovers out there!
        <br>Occasionally I will try to play my favorites on the piano (my go to instrument) and even attempt some chords on the ukulele, I haven't gotten very far with that though.
